# Asynchronous operations

Python offers several options for managing long running operations asynchronously. [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is the core library for supporting asynchronous operations, including [async](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def)/[await](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await).

# Classes

[Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) define data structures and behavior. Classes allow you to group data and functionality together.

# Managing the file system

Python's [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) provides operations and classes to access files and directories in the file system.

# Style Guidelines

## Formatting

Formatting makes code readable and easier to debug.

## Documentation

- [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) is a set of coding conventions for Python code
- [Docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) is the standard for documenting a module, function, class or method definition

## Linting

Linting helps you identify formatting and convention issues in your Python code

- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) Pylint is a linter for Python to help enforce coding standards and check for errors in Python code
- [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) will show you how to enable litners in VS Code
- [Type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) allow some interactive development environments and linters to enforce types

# Inheritance

[Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance) allows you to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. The parent or base class is the class being inherited from. The child or derived class is the class that inherits from another class.

# Lambdas

A [lambda](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp) function is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments but can only execute one expression.

# Mixins (multiple inheritance)

Python allows you to inherit from multiple classes. While the technical term for this is multiple inheritance, many developers refer to the use of more than one base class adding a mixin. These are commonly used in frameworks such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com).

- [Multiple Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance)
- [super](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent class
